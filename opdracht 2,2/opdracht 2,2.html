            <h2>what is HTML?</h2>
            <p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page.
                <br>
                It acts as a 'blueprint' to display data on a user's screen. This is the basic building block of
                <br>
                the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>what are HTML elements</h2>
                <p>Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be
                    displayed.</p>
                <h2>what is a tag?</h2>
                <p>An element consists of an opening and closing tag.
                    <br>
                     The data supplied between the tags will
                    be displayed per the instructions of the element</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?</h2>
                    <p>The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended
                        the data to appear on the screen.</p>
                        <h2>What are the basic HTML-Elements?</h2>
                        <p>The elements we learned about were html, head, body, 'p', span, div, and h1-h6</p>
                        <br>
                        <h1>More Elements</h1>
                        <h2>A-tag</h2>
                        <p>The 'a' (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other
                            areas within our own web page).
                            <br>
                             You will always see the 'a' element used with
                            the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.</p>
                            <img src="./photo's/Picture1.png" alt="">
                            <h2>Img-tag</h2>
                            <p>This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an 'src' attribute which
                                points to the address of the image to be displayed.
                                <br>
                                 NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in
                                they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:</p>
